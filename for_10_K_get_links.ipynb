(Would not use stock-based compensation detail because it does not always appear eg for companies where this is not relevant)\n",

    "* Stock-based compensation\n",
    "* Share-based compensation\n",

This means that the evidence for a significant difference in tax rates between tech and non-tech companies is not strong enough to be conclusive at a standard significance level. In summary, the linear regression model suggests that tech companies may have lower tax rates on average, but the evidence for this difference is not statistically significant at the conventional significance level.
